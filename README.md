# Image Super Resolution using Generative Adversarial Networks

* Abstract:
		Since computer was invented, scientists hope to create artificial intelligence stuff through the efficiency of computers. 		However, the computer performance is too low to get this target, and itâ€™s not have enough data for train, but with the 		semiconductor technology improvement and data collection, the artificial intelligence gets attention again, neural networks is 		widely used in many fields.
			We proposed a new architecture base on Generative Adversarial Network, and adding Structural Similarity as an loss 		function, and using Wasserstein distance replace
		Kullback-Leibler distance to improve the capability of discriminator, to generate a better high-resolution image.

Keywords: Deep Learning, Super-Resolution, Generative Adversarial Networks
