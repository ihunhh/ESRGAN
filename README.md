# Image Super Resolution using Generative Adversarial Networks

* Abstract:

<br> Since computer was invented, scientists hope to create artificial intelligence stuff through the efficiency of computers. However, the computer performance is too low to get this target, and itâ€™s not have enough data for train, but with the semiconductor technology improvement and data collection, the artificial intelligence gets attention again, neural networks is widely used in many fields.

* Architecture:
